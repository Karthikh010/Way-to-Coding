@Repository 
Annotation is a specialization of @Component annotation 
which is used to indicate that the class provides the 
mechanism for storage, retrieval, update, delete and 
search operation on objects


@Component 
is an annotation that allows Spring to 
automatically detect our custom beans. In other words, 
without having to write any explicit code, Spring will: 
Scan our application for classes annotated with 
@Component. Instantiate them and inject any 
specified dependencies into them. Inject them wherever 
needed.

@Autowired
Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to 
inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally 
uses setter or constructor injection. Autowiring can't 
be used to inject primitive and string values. 
It works with reference only.
